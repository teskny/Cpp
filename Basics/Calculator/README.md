# Calculator Project
**A recursive descent parser-based C++ calculator that evaluates arithmetic expressions and exponentiation.**

## Project Overview
This project implements a recursive descent parser in C++ to evaluate mathematical expressions with support for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and right-associative exponentiation. The parser manages operator precedence and handles error conditions through exceptions, demonstrating a clean and organized approach to parsing arithmetic expressions.

## Concepts Learned:
- The design and implementation of recursive descent parsing
- The importance of precise error handling using C++ exceptions
- The effective utilization of standard libraries such as <cmath> for mathematical computations and <string> for input processing

## Compilation and Execution with CMake
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
./executable-for-calculator.exe
```
